# PlanetView
This is a simple WebGL application which represents our solar system. The main focus is layed on rotation operations such as Euler rotation and rotation with Quaternions. 

This product is not very interactive and could be improved. Some points here:
* Adding awesome textures to planets
* Adding skydome
* Capturing mouse actions
* Attach to planets interactively
